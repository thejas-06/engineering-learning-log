# GenAI vs AGI vs ASI — What Stage Are We In?

This note clarifies the differences between Generative AI, Artificial General
Intelligence, and Artificial Superintelligence.

---

## Generative AI (GenAI)
This is the stage we are in today.

What it is:
- AI that generates new content (text, images, code, audio)
- Trained for specific tasks and domains

Examples:
- **GPT-5.2**
- **DALL-E 3**
- **Claude 4.5**

Key limitation:
- Strong at guidance and generation
- Cannot truly understand or act beyond its training scope

Mental analogy:
- A very smart assistant who can explain how to fix a bike,
  but cannot physically fix it or learn unrelated skills on its own

---

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
AGI refers to human-level intelligence across tasks.

What it would be able to do:
- Learn any skill independently
- Transfer knowledge between domains
- Adapt to new problems without retraining

Mental analogy:
- Hiring one person who can become a doctor, programmer, artist,
  or teacher just by learning the rules

Current status:
- We are moving toward AGI
- Even advanced models still lack true reasoning and general understanding

AGI does not yet exist.

## Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
ASI goes beyond human intelligence in every domain.

What it implies:
- Intelligence far exceeding the best human minds
- Problem-solving at speeds and scales humans cannot match

Mental analogy:
- Humans become the calculator; AI becomes the mind

Potential impact:
- Rapid scientific breakthroughs
- Solutions to problems like climate modeling or biology

Reality check:
- No real ASI systems exist
- Raises serious safety and control concerns

Some research (e.g., **Deepmind AlphaFold-3**) shows superhuman performance in narrow domains, not full ASI.

---

## Where we actually are
- We are firmly in the **GenAI** era
- Research is pushing toward **AGI**
- **ASI** remains a long-term and uncertain possibility

---

## One-line takeaway
GenAI generates, AGI generalizes, ASI surpasses — and only the first truly exists today.

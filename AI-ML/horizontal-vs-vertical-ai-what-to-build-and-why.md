# Horizontal AI vs Vertical AI — What to Build and Why

This note explains the difference between Horizontal AI and Vertical AI
and why this distinction matters for real-world AI products.

---

## Horizontal AI
Horizontal AI is built to work across many industries.

What it focuses on:
- Common tasks
- General workflows
- Broad applicability


Key characteristics:
- Train once, deploy everywhere
- Industry-agnostic
- Flexible but less specialized

---

## When Horizontal AI makes sense
Use Horizontal AI when:
- The problem exists in many industries
- Accuracy requirements are moderate
- Speed of deployment matters more than deep specialization

Examples:
- Customer support
- Analytics
- Marketing automation
- Cybersecurity tooling

---

## Vertical AI
Vertical AI is built for **one specific industry or task**.

What it focuses on:
- Domain-specific workflows
- Industry rules and terminology
- High precision and reliability

Examples:
- Medical imaging AI trained on radiology data
- Autonomous driving systems built only for driving

Key characteristics:
- Trained on specialized data
- Deep understanding of domain rules
- Harder to build, but more valuable

---

## When Vertical AI is necessary
Vertical AI is often required when:
- Errors are costly or dangerous
- Regulations are strict
- Domain knowledge is complex

Industries:
- Healthcare
- Finance
- Legal
- Manufacturing
- Autonomous systems

---

## Why this distinction matters now
Most foundation models (e.g., GPT-4–class systems) are **horizontal by default**.

The trend:
- Use horizontal models as a base
- Build vertical systems on top using:
  - Fine-tuning
  - RAG
  - Domain-specific data
  - Agentic workflows

---

## The 2025 insight
Horizontal AI wins on scale.  
Vertical AI wins on value.

Most successful products combine both.

---

## One-line takeaway
Horizontal AI scales across industries, but Vertical AI solves real problems deeply —
and that’s where most business value lies.

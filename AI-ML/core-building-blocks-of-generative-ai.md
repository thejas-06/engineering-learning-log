# Core Building Blocks of Generative AI

Modern generative AI systems can be understood through a small set of foundational ideas.

**Multimodality**  
AI systems are no longer limited to text. They can reason across text, images, audio, and video within a single model.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
Instead of relying purely on learned parameters, models can retrieve external information to ground responses in real data.

**Agentic AI**  
AI systems can plan, decide, and act autonomously to achieve goals rather than only responding to prompts.

**Fine-tuning**  
General-purpose models can be adapted to specific domains or tasks through additional targeted training.

**Prompt Engineering**  
The quality of AI output depends heavily on how intent is expressed through prompts.

These concepts together explain how current generative AI systems move from static text generators to adaptive, goal-driven tools.
